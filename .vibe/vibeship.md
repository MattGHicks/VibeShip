## Project: VibeShip
**Project ID:** a002c296-87b4-4499-88e3-ef52db24b744
**Status:** active

## Description
VibeShip is a project tracker for indie hackers and vibe coders. Import from GitHub, track your progress, and showcase what you've shipped.

## Where I Left Off
Just built the AI Integration feature - the core innovation of VibeShip. When users generate an API key, they get a comprehensive AI context prompt that instructs AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to:

1. Create a .vibe/ folder in their project with vibeship.md (context file) and .secrets (API credentials)
2. Read project context at session start
3. Update progress after completing work
4. Sync on git push

Uncommitted work (~916 lines across 8 files):
- lib/ai-prompt.ts: Full prompt generation system with setup instructions, behavioral triggers, and API examples
- components/projects/api-settings.tsx: Enhanced UI with "How it works" explainer and activity log
- app/(dashboard)/guide/page.tsx: New Getting Started guide page
- app/api/projects/[id]/screenshot/: Screenshot upload endpoint (new)
- supabase/migrations/20241203_storage_screenshots.sql: Storage bucket setup

Next steps:
- Test the full flow end-to-end (generate key → paste prompt → verify .vibe/ creation)
- Consider adding the Guide page to sidebar navigation
- Commit this batch of AI integration changes

## Lessons Learned
The AI prompt needs to be extremely detailed and prescriptive - AI tools work best with explicit step-by-step instructions rather than high-level goals. Including verification steps (check git remote, check .vibe/ exists) prevents AI from accidentally setting up the wrong project.
