## Project: VibeShip
**Project ID:** a002c296-87b4-4499-88e3-ef52db24b744
**Status:** active
**VibeShip:** http://localhost:3000/projects/a002c296-87b4-4499-88e3-ef52db24b744

## Description
VibeShip is a project tracker for indie hackers and vibe coders. Import from GitHub, track your progress, and showcase what you've shipped.

## Where I Left Off
Just pushed: .vibe folder system and enhanced AI integration (commit 804c8cd)

Shipped features:
- .vibe/ folder system for local project tracking (vibeship.md + .secrets)
- Guide page at /guide with workflow documentation
- Screenshot upload API endpoint
- Enhanced API settings UI with activity log
- Comprehensive AI context prompt with setup instructions

Next steps:
- Test full flow on production (vibe-ship.vercel.app)
- Consider adding more AI tools compatibility (Cursor, Windsurf)
- Add Guide link to public landing page
- Start working on Phase 2 features (tech stack tags, social features)

## Lessons Learned
The AI prompt needs to be extremely detailed and prescriptive - AI tools work best with explicit step-by-step instructions rather than high-level goals. Including verification steps (check git remote, check .vibe/ exists) prevents AI from accidentally setting up the wrong project.

## Tech Stack
- **AI Models:** Claude
- **Frameworks:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
- **Tools:** Supabase, Vercel, GitHub
